# Call Centre Application

## Contents

## 1.Introduction

The National Pandemic Flu Service (NPFS) Call Centre Application has two areas of functionality which are as follows:

* Clinical Assessment. If a Caller has flu like symptoms the call centre agent can use the application to take them
 through a series of questions to result in a clinical assessment of their condition. The outcome may be authorisation 
 of an antiviral or alternatively other care adive such as call 999, contact your GP etc 

* Manage URN. For a patient that has already been authorised for an antiviral this functionality allow the call agent 
to search for details of URN if they are lost plus check the status of a URN and also cancel an authorised antiviral before 
it has been dispensed

## Call Opening

### Selecting Calling Source

Select the appropriate Calling Source from the drop down list.

![][call_source]

Select **Not applicable** for an ordinary call. Most calls will be registered as an ordinary call, however
the call may be a specified call type e.g. Language Line or British Sign Language.

assessment can continue.

![][Terms_of_Use]

Select **Agree** if the Caller provides confirmation that they agree with the Terms of Use and wish to proceed with the assessment.

needs to be read to the Caller confirming why they cannot proceed and offering them the option to restart.

![][Decline]

### Current Location

This is important as all countries may not be NPFS at the same time. The outcome of the clinical advice may also
differ by UK country.

For foreign visitots, following the clinical assessment questions you will be asked to gather further official
patient identification information.

## Sample Testing Participation

### Overview

The **Swabbing** allows Public Health England to collect swabs from a sample of the infected population to provide data for analysis.

This page will only appear if the Caller has been assessed and they are going to be provided with an unique reference number for an anti-viral.

![][swabbing-consent-question]

If the Caller agrees to participate in sample testing they must provide contact details including address and telephone number. 
Address can be input via postcode search or entered manually. 

The address search will be prepopulated with the Postcode entered earlier in the assessment.This can be changed if required.

![][Address-lookup]

If the **Find Address** is selected another box will appear which will have a dropdown menu with all addresses that fall within the postcode entered.
The correct address should be confirmed with the call and **Confirm address** selected.

![][Address-confirm]

information supplied by the Caller.

![][Address-manual]


## Assessment Results

### Introducing the Summary


Follow the guidance in the grey floating panel on the right hand side.

Instead of reading the on-screen text at the beginning of the assessment summary, you should say:
**\"This is the end of the assessment. Please listen to the information I am about to provide carefully and write down the key points.\"**

![][Assessment]

**Clinical Advice** is higlighted and also has sidebars for emphasis.
These sections should be read **word-for-word** - remember the Caller needs to be clear what they should do and when

Pause in between each paragraph to allow the Caller to take in the information and make notes

**Antiviral Authorisation** - read this section **word-for-word**

![][URN]


Provide authorisation number carefully, using phonetic alphabet for \'alpha\' characters, ask Caller to repeat it back, checking each character - repeat process until
 they have it recorded correctly

> If the patient says they don\'t have a flu friend, remind them it can be anyone (family member, friend, neighbour, work colleague, etc)


## Finding a Collection Point

### Collection Point Identification Documentation

Make sure Caller is aware that ID is required for both the flu friend **AND** the patient in order to collect the antivirals. Accepted forms of identification 
are shown on the authorisation page

Additions forms of ID can be seen by selecting **View others form of Identification**.

When reading out items from the list, start at an appropriate place for the Caller, e.g. Passports for overseas visitors, 
and stop once they have indicated they have noted items they can access/produce

> For assessments that result in a \'no antiviral\' outcome, Agent scripting is as follows:
>
> *"Based on the answers provided, the Patient has **not** been recommended for an antiviral now.*
>
> *Not all assessments will result in the provision of an antiviral. In this case, the Patient should follow the clinical advice I am going to read out to you."*


Here is an example from an assessment that reaches an end-point where an anti-viral has not been recommended. Depending on the assessment, other information may also appear to advise the Caller.

![][non-authorised-assessment]


### Searching for a Collection Point

To help the Caller to identify a collection point that is convenient for them, select **Show nearest collection points**.

The Collection Point Finder will automatically search for the 5 nearest Collection Points based on the postcode provided for the assessment.

![][Collection_point_map]

The grey floating panel provides additional help / text if you are struggling to find a Collection Point local to the Caller

By clicking on the name of the Collection Point in the list, full details are provided for you to relay to the Caller.

There is also a direction link to googlemaps to assist in directing the Caller to the nearest collection point.

![][End_call]

The next screen will allow you to choose a reason for ending call and exiting the assessment.
