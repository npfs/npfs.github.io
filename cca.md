## Call Opening

### Collecting Patient Details

Introduce the first few questions with the phrase **\"I now need to find out some details about the Patient\"**.

Gather these details accurately, filling out all the boxes on the screen and confirming back with the Caller.

Patient Details must be entered correctly for the patient to be able to collect Antivirals (if they are issued). 

> **Remember** - getting the date of birth right is really important for correct dosage calculation - a valid date must be input for you to be able to click \'continue\'.




## Initial Assessment

### \'Emergency Check\' Questions

These questions must be read from the screen word-for-word after you have delivered the introduction.  If the Caller struggles to understand, you may use the alternative wording provided in the guidance panel.

Whilst they are written as 2 whole (sets of) questions, pause after each sub-question to get a response.

If the Caller answers \'yes\' to any of these questions (2 pages), record the answer and move on, you will advise them to contact 999.

Click on \'Exit\' to return to start screen ready for your next call.

If the caller answers no to all of the \'emergency check\' questions (2 pages) you will proceed to the next part of the assessment.




## Patient Data

### Introducing the Assessment

Following the Emergency Check questions, you will gather further Patient identification information.  Introduce these questions by saying: **\"I now need to find out some more details about the Patient.\"**

> **Note:** The caller may not be the patient.

Recent Travel if the caller cannot answer this question without help use the \'travel advice by country\' link to help.


### Patient Identification

Gather these details accurately, filling out all the boxes on the screen and confirming back with the Caller.  You must check spellings to ensure accuracy, using the phonetic alphabet where appropriate

The phonetic alphabet is available on every page in the grey floating panel on the right hand side 

Patient Details must be entered correctly for the patient to be able to collect Antivirals (if they are issued). 

If you make any errors in entering the information you must use the \'Undo\' feature to return to the necessary page to correct the information while the caller is still talking to you.




## Sample Testing Participation

### Overview

The **Swabbing** allows Public Health England to collect swabs from a sample of the infected population to provide data for analysis.

### What Happens Next

The patient will be asked for address details.  They *may* be sent a swabbing pack by post.




## Clinical Assessment Questions

These questions must be read from the screen **word-for-word**.  Use pauses to allow the Caller to think and respond.  If the Caller struggles to understand, you may use the alternative wording provided in the grey floating panel on the right.

Allow the caller time to respond to each question, do not click on a button until they have confirmed their answer to each question.

For the flu symptom question, pause to identify whether the Patient has a high temperature **before** moving on to read out symptoms.  

For the questions that follow, if the Caller answers \'yes\' to one part, record the answer and move on.




## Assessment Results

### Introducing the Summary

![][authorisation-intro]

Follow the guidance in the grey floating panel on the right hand side.

Instead of reading the on-screen text at the beginning of the assessment summary, you should say: 
**\"This is the end of the assessment. Please listen to the information I am about to provide carefully and write down the key points.\"**

**Clinical Advice** - read this section **word-for-word** - remember the Caller needs to be clear what they should do and when

Pause in between each paragraph to allow the Caller to take in the information and make notes 

**Antiviral Authorisation** - read this section **word-for-word** 


### URN

![][authorisation-urn]

Provide authorisation number carefully, using phonetic alphabet for \'alpha\' characters, ask caller to repeat it back, checking each character - repeat process until they have it recorded correctly

> If the patient says they don\'t have a flu friend, remind them it can be anyone (family member, friend, neighbour, work colleague, etc)
>
> If they maintain that they cannot find one, read the advice from the screen


### Collection Point Identification

![][authorisation-collection]

Make sure Caller is aware that ID is required for both the flu friend and the patient in order to collect the antivirals.  Accepted forms of identification are shown on the authorisation page.

When reading out items from the list, start at an appropriate place for the Caller, e.g. Passports for overseas visitors, and stop once they have indicated they have noted items they can access/produce

> For assessments that result in a \'no antiviral\' outcome, Agent scripting is as follows:
>
> **\"We have now reached the end of the assessment.**
>
> **The result is that an antiviral treatment course is NOT recommended for the Patient.**
>
> **However, if the Patient is not well please contact their local NHS Service.\"**


### Searching for Collection Point

To help the caller to identify a collection point that is convenient for them, click **Show nearest collection points**

Collection Point Finder will automatically search for the 5 nearest Collection Points  based on the postcode provided for the assessment.

You can manually change the postcode / enter a new postcode / Town / County that is convenient for the caller / flu friend

The grey floating panel provides additional help / text if you are Struggling to Find an ACP Local to the Caller and how to provide details on the Collection Points found

By clicking on the name of the Collection Point in the list, full details are provided for you to relay to the caller.
