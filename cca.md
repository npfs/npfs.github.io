# Call Centre Application

## Contents

## 1.Introduction

The National Pandemic Flu Service (NPFS) Call Centre Application has two areas of functionality which are as follows:

* Clinical Assessment. If a caller has flu like symptoms the call centre agent can use the application to take them
 through a series of questions to result in a clinical assessment of their condition. The outcome may be authorisation 
 of an antiviral or alternatively other care adive such as call 999, contact your GP etc 

* Manage URN. For a patient that has already been authorised for an antiviral this functionality allow the call agent 
to search for details of URN if they are lost plus check the status of a URN and also cancel an authorised antiviral before 
it has been dispensed

### Feedback - Tell us what you think

You can provide feedback on the Pandemic Flu service at any time whilst on the portal, by clicking the ”Provide feedback on the Pandemic Flu service” link on the right of every page.

This is important, and will help us improve the service offered.

This can be used either for feedback from your own experience, or for the patient you are talking to, for example if the questions are unclear for them.

![][feedback-tell-us-what-you-think]

This will allow you to enter in the type of feedback, including a free text field to provide specific information.

![][feedback-form]

You (or the patient if it is their feedback) can choose to be contacted about this feedback, or not.

If they choose to be contacted, the next page will ask for their name and contact details.


### Other Supporting Functionality

In addition to feedback there is a range of other supporting functionality which is available throughout any assessment these include:

* Language Support - the portal can be used in english or welsh by selecting the appropriate link.
* British Sign Language interpreter service
* Collection point finder - to allow the nearest collection point to be located without having to complete an assessment
* Supplementary Pandemic Flu information. A separate link is provided for information on flu symptoms for each county


## 2.Completing a Flu Assessment

## Call Opening

### Selecting Calling Source

Select the appropriate Calling Source from the drop down list.

![][call-source]

Select **Not applicable** for an ordinary call. Most calls will be registered as an ordinary call, however
the call may be a specified call type e.g. Language Line or British Sign Language.

Use **Other - please specify** for any other type of call, or a misdirected call, e.g. caller wanted NHS111.
It is mandatory to add a note of explanation before closing the call.

### Terms of Use

The Call Center Advisor should read the Terms of Use to the caller. The caller needs to agree to the Terms of Use before the 
assessment can continue.

![][Terms_of_Use]

Select **Agree** if the caller provides confirmation that they agree with the Terms of Use and wish to proceed with the assessment.

If the caller does not accept the Terms of Use select **Disagree** which will end the assessment. A further screen will be presented that 
needs to be read to the caller confirming why they cannot proceed and offering them the option to restart.

! [][Terms_of_Use_1]

### Current Location

The caller needs to confirm which UK country the patient is located at the moment.

This is important as all countries may not be NPFS at the same time. The outcome of the clinical advice may also
differ by UK country.

### Uk or Foreign Visitor

The caller needs to confirm whether the patient is a UK resident or a foreign visitor.

For foreign visitots, following the clinical assessment questions you will be asked to gather further official
patient identification information.

! [] [Foreign_visitor]

Record these details accurately and confirm back with the caller.

You must check spellings to ensure accuracy using the phonetic alphabet where appropriate.


### Collecting Patient Details













## Manage URN

![][manage-urn-button]

The Manage URN function can be used for a number of purposes:

* Retrieving a previously issued URN for a caller, for example if they have forgotten it
* Checking on the status of a previously issued URN, for example if it might have expired
* Cancelling a URN, for example if the caller wants to complete a new assessment, as their symptoms have changed


### Locating a URN

You can find a URN in the system using either the URN itself, or by supplying a post code, date of birth and gender.

![][manage-urn-search-form]

### Search Results and Cancelling a URN

All URNs matching the supplied search criteria are shown.

> **Note:** It is possible and valid for multiple URNs with the same number to exist.
>
> Ensure that the correct URN for the caller is identified before proceeding.

![][manage-urn-search-result]

To **cancel** a URN, select the correct row in the table and click the **Cancel URN** button

![][manage-urn-results-select]

The next screen will prompt you to provide a reason for cancellation. The option of “Other” will prompt you to enter details in a free text box.

![][cancel-urn]

You will then be prompted to Confirm the cancellation of this URN:

![][cancel-urn-review-details]

Clicking on Proceed will cancel the URN, providing confirmation.

![][cancel-urn-confirmation]

You can now proceed with a fresh assessment of the patient.

Clicking Restart will return you to the main screen.


## Call Opening





### Collecting Patient Details

Introduce the first few questions with the phrase **\"I now need to find out some details about the Patient\"**.

Gather these details accurately, filling out all the boxes on the screen and confirming back with the Caller.

Patient Details must be entered correctly for the patient to be able to collect Antivirals (if they are issued).

> **Remember** - getting the date of birth right is really important for correct dosage calculation - a valid date must be input for you to be able to click \'continue\'.




## Initial Assessment

### \'Emergency Check\' Questions

These questions must be read from the screen word-for-word after you have delivered the introduction.  If the Caller struggles to understand, you may use the alternative wording provided in the guidance panel.

Whilst they are written as 2 whole (sets of) questions, pause after each sub-question to get a response.

If the Caller answers \'yes\' to any of these questions (2 pages), record the answer and move on, you will advise them to contact 999.

Click on \'Exit\' to return to start screen ready for your next call.

If the caller answers no to all of the \'emergency check\' questions (2 pages) you will proceed to the next part of the assessment.




## Patient Data

### Introducing the Assessment

Following the Emergency Check questions, you will gather further Patient identification information.  Introduce these questions by saying: **\"I now need to find out some more details about the Patient.\"**

> **Note:** The caller may not be the patient.

Recent Travel if the caller cannot answer this question without help use the \'travel advice by country\' link to help.


### Patient Identification

Gather these details accurately, filling out all the boxes on the screen and confirming back with the Caller.  You must check spellings to ensure accuracy, using the phonetic alphabet where appropriate

The phonetic alphabet is available on every page in the grey floating panel on the right hand side

Patient Details must be entered correctly for the patient to be able to collect Antivirals (if they are issued).

If you make any errors in entering the information you must use the \'Undo\' feature to return to the necessary page to correct the information while the caller is still talking to you.




## Sample Testing Participation

### Overview

The **Swabbing** allows Public Health England to collect swabs from a sample of the infected population to provide data for analysis.

This page will only appear if the caller has been assessed and they are going to be provided with an unique reference number for an anti-viral.

![][swabbing-consent-question]



### What Happens Next

The patient will be asked for address details.  They *may* be sent a swabbing pack by post.

You can either find their address using their postcode:

![][postcode-address-finder]

Or you can enter the address manually:

![][postcode-address-finder-screen2]


## Clinical Assessment Questions

These questions must be read from the screen **word-for-word**.  Use pauses to allow the Caller to think and respond.  If the Caller struggles to understand, you may use the alternative wording provided in the grey floating panel on the right.

Allow the caller time to respond to each question, do not click on a button until they have confirmed their answer to each question.

For the flu symptom question, pause to identify whether the Patient has a high temperature **before** moving on to read out symptoms.

For the questions that follow, if the Caller answers \'yes\' to one part, record the answer and move on.




## Assessment Results

### Introducing the Summary

![][authorisation-intro]

Follow the guidance in the grey floating panel on the right hand side.

Instead of reading the on-screen text at the beginning of the assessment summary, you should say:
**\"This is the end of the assessment. Please listen to the information I am about to provide carefully and write down the key points.\"**

**Clinical Advice** - read this section **word-for-word** - remember the Caller needs to be clear what they should do and when

Pause in between each paragraph to allow the Caller to take in the information and make notes

**Antiviral Authorisation** - read this section **word-for-word**


### URN

![][authorisation-urn]

Provide authorisation number carefully, using phonetic alphabet for \'alpha\' characters, ask caller to repeat it back, checking each character - repeat process until they have it recorded correctly

> If the patient says they don\'t have a flu friend, remind them it can be anyone (family member, friend, neighbour, work colleague, etc)
>
> If they maintain that they cannot find one, read the advice from the screen


### Collection Point Identification

![][authorisation-collection]

Make sure Caller is aware that ID is required for both the flu friend and the patient in order to collect the antivirals.  Accepted forms of identification are shown on the authorisation page.

When reading out items from the list, start at an appropriate place for the Caller, e.g. Passports for overseas visitors, and stop once they have indicated they have noted items they can access/produce

> For assessments that result in a \'no antiviral\' outcome, Agent scripting is as follows:
>
> *"Based on the answers provided, the Patient has **not** been recommended for an antiviral now.*
>
> *Not all assessments will result in the provision of an antiviral. In this case, the Patient should follow the clinical advice I am going to read out to you."*


Here is an example from an assessment that reaches an end-point where an anti-viral has not been recommended. Depending on the assessment, other information may also appear to advise the caller.

![][non-authorised-assessment]


### Searching for Collection Point

To help the caller to identify a collection point that is convenient for them, click **Show nearest collection points**

Collection Point Finder will automatically search for the 5 nearest Collection Points  based on the postcode provided for the assessment.

You can manually change the postcode / enter a new postcode / Town / County that is convenient for the caller / flu friend

The grey floating panel provides additional help / text if you are Struggling to Find an ACP Local to the Caller and how to provide details on the Collection Points found

By clicking on the name of the Collection Point in the list, full details are provided for you to relay to the caller.


### Ending the Call Mid-Assessment

If a user ends the call, you should press the “End Call” button in the grey “floaty box”.

![][floaty-box-tabs]

The next screen will allow you to choose a reason for ending call and exiting the assessment.

In addition to the drop-down list, there is a free-text field to enter supporting information.

![][exit-assessment-reason]


### Feedback - Tell us what you think

You can provide feedback on the Pandemic Flu service at any time whilst on the portal, by clicking the ”Provide feedback on the Pandemic Flu service” link on the right of every page.

This is important, and will help us improve the service offered.

This can be used either for feedback from your own experience, or for the patient you are talking to, for example if the questions are unclear for them.

![][feedback-tell-us-what-you-think]

This will allow you to enter in the type of feedback, including a free text field to provide specific information.

![][feedback-form]
