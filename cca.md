## Getting Started

Open this link to access to NPFS Call Centre Application [www.nationalpandemicfluservice.nhs.uk/callcentre](https://www.nationalpandemicfluservice.nhs.uk/callcentre).  It may be advisable to create a bookmark if you will access the application frequently.

At any time you can safely use the **training** system to become familiar with the functions of the live system.  Any actions you take will not be reflected in the live system and you will have no impact on services or patients.
