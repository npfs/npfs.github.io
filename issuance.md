## Dealing with Issues

### Duplicate URN

On rare occasions a duplicate URN may be issued by the NPFS system.

If this occurs, the demographic details of the patient will be displayed at the point of searching for a URN.

You must select the record associated with the person attending for issuance - use the ID they have with them to confirm this.


### Status of URN is Expired

Each URN is only valid for 7 days - this is identified at the time of the completed assessment and is important for patient safety

If a URN has expired this will be marked next to the URN when you conduct a search on the system (either via URN Lookup or Recover URN and you will not be able to issue the antivirals


### Status of URN is Issued

Each URN is only able to be used to collect one dose of antivirals - this  is important for patient safety

If a URN has already been issued \(i.e. antivirals collected\) this will be marked next to the URN when you conduct a search on the system \(either via URN Lookup or Recover URN\) and you will not be able to issue the antivirals

Details of whether the antivirals were issued to the Patient or a Flu Friend and when they were dispensed is also displayed.


### Feedback - Tell us what you think

You can provide feedback on the Pandemic Flu service at any time whilst on the portal, by clicking the ”Provide feedback on the Pandemic Flu service” link on the right of every page.

This is important, and will help us improve the service offered.

This can be used either for feedback from your own experience, or for the patient you are talking to, for example if the questions are unclear for them.

![][feedback-tell-us-what-you-think]

This will allow you to enter in the type of feedback, including a free text field to provide specific information.

![][feedback-form]

You (or the patient if it is their feedback) can choose to be contacted about this feedback, or not.

If they choose to be contacted, the next page will ask for their name and contact details.
