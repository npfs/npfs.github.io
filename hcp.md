# Health Care Professional Application

## Contents

## 1.Introduction

The National Pandemic Flu Service (NPFS) Health Care Professional has two areas of functionality which are as follows:

* Clinical Assessment. If a Caller has flu like symptoms the call centre agent can use the application to take them
 through a series of questions to result in a clinical assessment of their condition. The outcome may be authorisation 
 of an antiviral or alternatively other care adive such as call 999, contact your GP etc 

* Manage URN. For a patient that has already been authorised for an antiviral this functionality allow the call agent 
to search for details of URN if they are lost plus check the status of a URN and also cancel an authorised antiviral before 
it has been dispensed

![][Bypass-algoritm] 

Note: Heathcare Professional – Non GP and Health sector employee will always have to follow the algorithm.

There are critical pieces of information that need to be submitted for the system to advise on an appropriate treatment course for each assessment.


## Sample Testing Participation

The **Swabbing** allows Public Health England to collect swabs from a sample of the infected population to provide data for analysis.

This page will only appear if the patient has been assessed and they are going to be provided with an unique reference number for an anti-viral.

![][swabbing-consent-question]

If the patient agrees to participate in sample testing they must provide contact details including address and telephone number. 
Address can be input via postcode search or entered manually. 

The address search will be prepopulated with the Postcode entered earlier in the assessment.This can be changed if required.

If the **Find Address** is selected another box will appear which will have a dropdown menu with all addresses that fall within the postcode entered.

![][Address-lookup]

The correct address should be confirmed with the call and **Confirm address** selected.

If the address cannot be found the patients address can be entered manually following the **Enter address manually** link and populating the following fields with 
information supplied by the patient.

![][alt-dosage]

If an antiviral has been authorised and not issued from locally held stock a patient will be issued with a URN.

the ID requirements for antiviral collection.

**Note: If an antiviral has been issued from locally-held stock, a URN and advice how to   find a collection point. This information should be ignored as not relevant
 as the patient already has their antiviral and does not need to go to a collection point.**
