## Getting Started

Open this link to access the NPFS Call Centre Application [www.nationalpandemicfluservice.nhs.uk/hcp](https://www.nationalpandemicfluservice.nhs.uk/hcp).  It may be advisable to create a bookmark if you will access the application frequently.

At any time you can safely use the **training** system to become familiar with the functions of the live system.  Any actions you take will not be reflected in the live system and you will have no impact on services or patients.

## Carrying out an Assessment

A grey hover box will appear on every screen from this point onwards to record each answer you have input should you need to refer to it with the Patient at any stage


#### End Call

Click here (available on every page) to end an assessment at any stage.


#### Undo

This takes you back to the previous back should you need to change a submitted answer

> Enter the requested **Patient Details** and **Patient Identification** information.


#### Non-GPs

You are required to use the Clinical Algorithm to assess a patient - read the questions to the patient and enter their responses until you reach an outcome.


#### GPs Only

You will be asked whether you wish to **\'Follow algorithm\'** or **\'Bypass & self-prescribe\'**

> Select the appropriate button to continue




## Bypass & Self-Prescribe Assessment

There are critical pieces of information that need to be submitted for the system to advise on an appropriate treatment course for each assessment.

> Answer the presented questions until you are requested to **\'Select a treatment course\'**

The system will advise which drug & dose is recommended based on the information provided.

> Select the antiviral from the drop-down list that you wish to issue for the patient 

If you have stock of the drug you can chose to issue to the patient at this point (and record the dispense reference).

Alternatively you can select **\'No\'** under **\'Issue from locally-held stock\'** to issue them with a URN to take to an Antiviral Collection Point




## Assessment Results

Once the Assessment has been completed, either by following the algorithm or bypassing it, the Results page is presented.

This page has useful information for the patient, either read it to them or use the **\'Print this Page\'** button at the bottom to provide them with a  paper copy of the information.

If an antiviral has been authorised and the patient needs to collect from an ACP you must ensure they record the URN generated for them by the system and advise them of the ID requirements for anti-viral collection.

Use **\'Show nearest collection points\'** to help the patient locate a convenient ACP

Use **\'Restart\'** to end the assessment and return to the start of the assessment for the next patient
